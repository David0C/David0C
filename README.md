Electronic Engineer focused on developing technological solutions for football. <img src="https://github.com/David0C/David0C/blob/d9d5c6a89cdb64054decf3a9d1ce77c37ec893db/ball-football.webp" alt="" height="20">

I aim to bridge the gap between complex engineering (hardware, databases and systems) and its practical application on the field, using data analysis and digital tools.

I am looking for opportunities in Sports Technology companies where I can apply my technical skills to drive innovation and data-driven decision making in football.

#### Want to Build Your Own?

Do you like my profile and want to build your own? It's very simple. GitHub recently added a new feature called **Profile Readmes**. For it to work, do the following:

1. Create a *special* GitHub repository with your username as repository name. My username is `DennisHartrampf` so my profile readme repository has the name `DennisHartrampf`.
1. Add a `README.md` to this repository.
1. Put some cool content about yourself (or anything you want) into `README.md`.

And that's about it. The `README.md` of your profile readme repository will be displayed on your profile page. If you need inspiration, you can check out [this repository](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) which contains a curated list of nice profile readme repositories.
